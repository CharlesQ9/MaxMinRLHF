# Reward Learning with EM

See examples in EM_TULU.slurm

# Max Min RLHF Alignment
## Reward Training
Run job_train_seperate.slurm and job_biased_single_reward_model.slurm
## PPO
Run jobrlhf.slurm for baseline and run jobrrlhf.slurm for max min RLHF 
## Generation
Run job_generate1.slurm or job_generate1_llama2_P1_maxmin.slurm as examples
## GPT4 Evaluation
Run GPT4_evaluation.py
